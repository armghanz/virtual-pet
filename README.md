# Virtual Pet

Virtual Pet is a JavaScript project for the CommandSHIFT Full Stack Development Bootcamp. 

Virtual pets are great because they're made of JavaScript, they can do literally anything, and they don't have any of the drawbacks of regular pets.

The pets we're going to make will have the following features:

- A name 📛
- They can get older 👵
- As they get older, they get hungrier and less fit 🏋️
- We can walk our pet to increase it's fitness. 🏃‍♂️
- We can feed our pet to decrease it's hunger. 🍕
- We can talk to our pet to see if it needs feeding or walking 🚶
- If our pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE 💀
- If our pet gets to 30 days old it will DIE 😢
